    <h1>Milkis</h1>
    <h2>A Korean soft drink produced by Lotte Chilsung</h2>
    <p>The calm, cool, and collected beverage of my youth. Whenever I first pitch this drink to friends and family, it's always met with questioning looks [and maybe a litle bit of digust if your unfamiliar with anything like it]. But I always promise, it's absolutely delicious and refreshing. The original flavor is a tart and sweet carbonated yogurt soda that makes you feel a bit like a kid again. I can also assure that all of the other flavors that have been made are just as good. But they can never beat the OG. <br> Try it ASAP if you haven't already. <br> It's okay. <br> Take your time. <br> I'll wait.</p>
